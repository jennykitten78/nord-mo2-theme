# Nord ModOrganizer 2 Theme

I loved the Nord theme and used it for my desktop on all my operating systems and I really love playing Skyrim so I figured why not make a matching theme for ModOrganizer 2. This is still very much a WIP build, but it is coming along.

**Uses resources from VS15-Dark from chintsu_kun as a base for the limited graphics used. Thank you.**

**_If you have any suggestions or ideas, please submit them as an issue. Thank you!_**
